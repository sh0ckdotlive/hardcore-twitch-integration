# Hardcore Twitch Integration
Welcome to the hardcore-twitch-integration repository! This repository is to store the project created by me to spice up my hardcore world on my [streams](https://twitch.tv/sh0ckR6)!<br/>
This bukkit plugin does require a working WebSocket server that can connect to the Twitch API, so the plugin won't work from compilation. This is also why there will be no releases published until the plugin is refined.

## FAQ
### Will this plugin ever become available for release?
Yes! I plan on fully developing this plugin and publishing stable releases for users to download and use in their own streams!

### When do you think you will publish your first release?
~~I'm hoping to push out a stable release by next month, as well as an alpha release sometime in the next 2 weeks.~~ Well that kinda died. This plugin might not be getting an alpha for a while as I have a bunch of other stuff I need to handle first. Development on this plugin is taking a backseat will be done when I feel like it, but contributions are more than welcome if you want to see this finished faster!

### Will there be customization options on release, or will I need coding knowledge to add my own rewards?
The first stable release will come with customization without the need of any programming/coding knowledge! The first few alpha and beta releases leading up to the first stable release will not have any customization options in terms of channel point rewards; however, there will be a `config.yml` included with the very first alpha release for basic setup.
